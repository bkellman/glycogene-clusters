# glycogene-clusters

# Contents

### uniprot
-  uniprot-cazy-bacteria.tsv.gz - a large tsv with many cross references

### CAZy
- CAZy_DB_\*.csv - database of glycogenes

### to do
- annotate genes with nucleotide sequences (genbank -> enz/embl) @Cameron, can you add this?
- annotate genes with likey Endo/Exo/Both (should be somewhere on KEGG or get partial set from GlyDeG paper)
- map EC <-> reaction rules (w/James or w/Frederique)
- construct EC heirarchy
- make heirarchy computable
